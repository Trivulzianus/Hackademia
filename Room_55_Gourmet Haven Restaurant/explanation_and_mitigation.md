## **1. Insecure Authentication Mechanism**

### **Vulnerability Details:**
- **Location:** `/login` and `/admin` routes.
- **Issue:** The application uses a simple cookie-based authentication mechanism where a cookie named `auth_token` is set to a static value `'admin_authenticated'` upon successful login. The `/admin` route checks for this exact cookie value to grant access.

### **Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorised Access:** An attacker can manually set the `auth_token` cookie in their browser to `'admin_authenticated'`, bypassing the authentication check and gaining access to the admin panel without valid credentials.
  
  **Steps:**
  1. Use browser developer tools or a tool like [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) to modify the `auth_token` cookie.
  2. Set `auth_token=admin_authenticated`.
  3. Navigate to `/admin` to access sensitive admin functionalities and data.

### **Impact:**
- **Unauthorized Access:** Attackers can access the admin panel, view sensitive information (e.g., `FLAG{SensitiveDataExposure}`), and potentially manipulate administrative settings.
- **Data Exposure:** Sensitive data exposed in the admin panel can lead to further breaches if leveraged appropriately.

### **Preventive Measures (Best Practices):**
- **Use Secure Authentication Sessions:**
  - Implement Flask's built-in session management using `flask_login` or similar extensions that handle session security robustly.
  - Store session identifiers securely, ensuring they are random, unique, and not easily guessable.
  
- **Password Hashing:**
  - Store hashed and salted passwords using strong algorithms (e.g., bcrypt, Argon2) instead of plain text.
  
- **Implement Proper Authorization:**
  - Differentiate user roles and permissions rigorously.
  - Ensure that authorization checks are performed server-side and are not solely reliant on client-side data like cookies.
  
- **Use Secure Cookies:**
  - Set cookies with the `HttpOnly` and `Secure` flags to prevent client-side scripts from accessing them and ensure they are only transmitted over HTTPS.
  
- **Avoid Hardcoding Credentials:**
  - Do not hardcode sensitive tokens or credentials in the codebase. Use environment variables or secure storage solutions.
