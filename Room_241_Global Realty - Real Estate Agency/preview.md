Welcome to the **Global Realty Web Application Lab**!

This lab provides a simulated environment of a real estate agency's online portal where agents can log in to access exclusive property listings. The application is hosted in a cloud environment, so no additional setup is required.

### Getting Started

Use one of the following agent credentials to access the portal:

- **Username:** `agent1`  
  **Password:** `password1`

- **Username:** `agent2`  
  **Password:** `password2`

- **Username:** `agent3`  
  **Password:** `password3`

### What to Explore

- **Login Functionality:** Access the agent portal using the provided credentials.
- **Exclusive Listings:** View and interact with the list of top properties available to authenticated agents.

Feel free to explore the application's features and assess its security within this controlled environment. Happy testing!
