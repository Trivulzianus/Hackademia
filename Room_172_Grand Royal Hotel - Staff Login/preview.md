**Grand Royal Hotel Staff Login Lab**

Welcome to the Grand Royal Hotel Staff Login Lab. In this exercise, you'll interact with a simulated hotel management system's login interface designed for staff members. The application is hosted in a cloud environment, eliminating the need for any setup on your part.

**Start Testing with the Following Credentials:**
- **Username:** `admin`
- **Password:** `admin123`

Use these credentials to access the admin panel and explore the application's features. Your goal is to assess the security mechanisms in place and identify potential areas for improvement.

Happy testing!
