**TechNova Solutions Web Application Lab**

Welcome to the TechNova Solutions Web Application Lab! This lab provides you with access to a simulated company website built using Flask, showcasing various features and functionalities typical of modern web applications. Your objective is to assess the security posture of the application, identify potential vulnerabilities, and apply your penetration testing skills to enhance its defenses.

The application is hosted in a cloud environment, allowing you to begin testing immediately without any additional setup. Navigate through the site, interact with its components, and utilize your expertise to uncover and address security challenges.

Happy testing!
