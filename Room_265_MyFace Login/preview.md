### Lab Preview: Vulnerable Web Application Exercise

Welcome to the Vulnerable Web Application Lab! In this exercise, you will interact with a deliberately insecure Python-based Flask application designed to enhance your web security testing skills.

#### Objectives:
- Explore and identify security flaws within a web application.
- Practice exploiting vulnerabilities in a controlled environment.
- Understand the importance of secure coding practices.

#### Getting Started:
No setup is required as the application is hosted in a cloud environment.

#### Access Credentials:
To begin testing, use one of the following user accounts to log in:

- **Username:** `alice`
  **Password:** `password123`

- **Username:** `bob`
  **Password:** `mypassword`

- **Username:** `admin`
  **Password:** `adminpass`

#### Access the Application:
- Navigate to the application URL provided in your lab environment.
- Use the credentials above to log in and start your security assessment.

**Note:** Remember to focus on identifying and understanding potential security weaknesses without disrupting the application's availability.

Good luck, and happy testing!
