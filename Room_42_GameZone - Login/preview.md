Welcome to the **GameZone Web Application Security Lab**!

In this lab, you'll interact with a simulated gaming platform where users can log in, view their dashboards, and explore profiles. Your objective is to navigate the application, understand its functionalities, and identify potential security aspects through hands-on testing.

**Getting Started:**

Use the following credentials to access the application:

- **Username:** `player1`
- **Password:** `password1`

Once logged in, you can explore different features and experiment with the application's behavior to uncover deeper functionalities.

Good luck and happy testing!
