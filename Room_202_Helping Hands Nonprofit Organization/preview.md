Welcome to the **Helping Hands Nonprofit Organization Lab**! In this interactive exercise, you'll explore a simulated donation platform designed to enhance your web application security skills. The lab is hosted in a cloud environment, allowing you to dive right in without any setup.

**Getting Started:**
- **Home Page:** Begin at the homepage to navigate through the donation process.
- **Donation Workflow:** Submit a donation and observe how the application handles your input.
- **Explore Routes:** Interact with various endpoints to understand the application's flow.

As you navigate through the application, pay close attention to how different components interact and consider potential security implications. Happy testing!
