**Lab Preview: National Agency of Cyber Security (NACS) Web Application**

Welcome to the NACS Web Application Lab! In this exercise, you'll explore a simulated government cybersecurity platform designed to showcase common web functionalities. Navigate through various sections such as Home, News, Policies, and Contact to familiarize yourself with the application's structure and features.

To dive deeper and access restricted areas like the Admin Panel, you'll need specific credentials. Use the following details to begin your exploration:

- **Admin URL:** `/admin`
- **Required Header for Admin Access:** `X-Admin-Auth` with the value `secretpassword`

Engage with the application in this cloud-based environment without any setup, and challenge yourself to uncover and understand the underlying mechanisms that protect and manage the platform.

Happy testing!
