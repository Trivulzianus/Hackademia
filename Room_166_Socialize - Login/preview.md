### Lab Preview: Exploring a Sample Web Application

Welcome to the **Vulnerable Web App Lab**, where you'll analyze and test the security of a pre-deployed Python Flask application hosted in a cloud environment. This lab provides a hands-on opportunity to identify and understand common web vulnerabilities through practical experimentation.

#### Getting Started

Use the credentials below to access the application and begin your security assessment:

- **Username:** `john_doe`
- **Password:** `password123`

Navigate to the application's URL and log in using the provided account. From there, explore the application's features and behavior to uncover potential security issues.

**Happy Testing!**
