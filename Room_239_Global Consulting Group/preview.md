### Global Consulting Group Web Application Lab

Welcome to the **Global Consulting Group Web Application Lab**. This Flask-based application simulates a real-world consulting firm's platform where users can submit project details in XML format.

**Getting Started:**
- **Access the Application:** Navigate to the homepage of the deployed lab environment.
- **Submit Project Details:** Use the provided form to enter and submit your project information in XML format.
- **Review Results:** After submission, review the processed details and any feedback provided by the application.

**Objective:**
Explore the XML handling functionality to identify potential security issues. Analyze how the application processes XML data and assess the robustness of its input validation mechanisms.

**No setup is required** as the lab is hosted in a cloud environment, allowing you to focus solely on testing and learning.

Good luck, and happy testing!
