### Vulnerable Web Application Lab Preview

Welcome to the **Real Estate Agency Web Application Security Lab**. This lab features a cloud-hosted Python Flask web application that simulates a real estate platform where users can browse property listings and administrators can manage property data.

#### **Features:**
- **Property Listings:** Browse a variety of properties with details such as title, description, price, and images.
- **Property Details:** View comprehensive information about each property.
- **Admin Panel:** Manage property listings by adding new properties through the admin interface.

#### **Getting Started:**
1. **Access the Application:**
   - Open your web browser and navigate to the provided cloud-hosted URL where the application is running.

2. **Explore the Features:**
   - **Home Page:** Browse through the available properties.
   - **Property Details:** Click on "View Details" for any property to see more information.
   - **Admin Panel:** Access the admin interface by navigating to `/admin` (e.g., `https://your-app-url.com/admin`) to manage property listings.

3. **No Setup Required:**
   - The application is pre-deployed in a cloud environment, so you can start testing immediately without any additional configuration.

#### **Objective:**
Your goal is to assess the security of the web application by identifying and exploiting potential vulnerabilities. Focus on evaluating the application's security posture, especially areas related to configuration and access controls.

Good luck, and happy testing!
