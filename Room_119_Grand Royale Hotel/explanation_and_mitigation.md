The provided Flask web application contains a critical security vulnerability known as **SQL Injection**. This vulnerability arises from the way user inputs are handled in the `/login` route, allowing attackers to manipulate the SQL queries executed by the application. Below is a detailed explanation of the exploitation process, followed by best practices to prevent such vulnerabilities in the future.

---

## **Vulnerability Explanation: SQL Injection in the `/login` Route**

### **How the Vulnerability Occurs**

In the `/login` route, the application processes user authentication by directly embedding user-supplied `username` and `password` into an SQL query using Python's string formatting:

```python
query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '{}' AND password = '{}'".format(username, password)
c.execute(query)
```

This approach does **not** sanitize or parameterize the user inputs, making the application susceptible to SQL Injection attacks. An attacker can craft input that alters the intended SQL query's structure, potentially bypassing authentication or manipulating the database.

### **Exploitation Example**

#### **Scenario: Bypassing Authentication to Access the Admin Panel**

An attacker aims to gain unauthorized access to the administrator panel without knowing the admin credentials. Here's how they can exploit the vulnerability:

1. **Crafting Malicious Inputs:**

   - **Username:** `admin' --`
   - **Password:** `irrelevant`

2. **Resulting SQL Query:**

   The malicious inputs modify the SQL query as follows:

   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'admin' --' AND password = 'irrelevant'
   ```

   - The `--` sequence denotes a comment in SQL, causing the rest of the query (`AND password = 'irrelevant'`) to be ignored.
   - The executed query effectively becomes:

     ```sql
     SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'admin'
     ```

3. **Authentication Bypass:**

   - If a user with the username `admin` exists in the `users` table, the query returns that user's record regardless of the provided password.
   - The application checks `if result`, finds it true, and further checks `if username == 'admin'`, which redirects the attacker to the admin panel.

#### **Alternative Exploitation: Retrieving All Users**

An attacker might also use an input to retrieve all user records:

1. **Inputs:**

   - **Username:** `' OR '1'='1`
   - **Password:** `' OR '1'='1`

2. **Resulting SQL Query:**

   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '' OR '1'='1' AND password = '' OR '1'='1'
   ```

   - The condition `'1'='1'` is always true, causing the query to return all records in the `users` table.
   - Depending on how the application handles multiple returned records, this might grant unauthorized access or leak sensitive information.

### **Potential Impact**

- **Unauthorized Access:** Attackers can gain admin privileges without valid credentials.
- **Data Leakage:** Sensitive user information can be extracted from the database.
- **Database Manipulation:** Attackers might modify or delete data within the database.

## **Best Practices to Prevent SQL Injection**

To safeguard the application against SQL Injection and other related vulnerabilities, developers should adhere to the following best practices:

### **1. Use Parameterized Queries (Prepared Statements)**

Instead of embedding user inputs directly into SQL queries, use parameterized queries which treat user inputs as data rather than executable code.

**Revised `/login` Route Using Parameterized Queries:**

```python
@app.route('/login', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def login():
    error = None
    if request.method == 'POST':
        username = request.form['username']
        password = request.form['password']
        conn = sqlite3.connect('hotel.db')
        c = conn.cursor()
        # Use parameterized query to prevent SQL injection
        query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ? AND password = ?"
        c.execute(query, (username, password))
        result = c.fetchone()
        conn.close()
        if result:
            if result[1] == 'admin':  # Assuming username is the second column
                return redirect(url_for('admin'))
            else:
                error = 'Access denied. Administrators only.'
        else:
            error = 'Invalid credentials.'
    return render_template_string('''...''', error=error)
```

**Benefits:**

- **Prevents SQL Injection:** User inputs are treated as parameters, eliminating the risk of altering the SQL query structure.
- **Enhances Code Clarity:** Separates SQL logic from data inputs, making the code easier to read and maintain.

### **2. Validate and Sanitize User Inputs**

Implement input validation to ensure that user-supplied data conforms to expected formats and types.

**Techniques:**

- **Whitelist Validation:** Allow only known good inputs (e.g., specific characters, lengths).
- **Type Checking:** Ensure inputs match expected data types (e.g., integers, strings).

### **3. Use ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) Frameworks**

ORMs like SQLAlchemy abstract database interactions, handling query construction and parameterization automatically.

**Example with SQLAlchemy:**

```python
from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy

app.config['SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI'] = 'sqlite:///hotel.db'
db = SQLAlchemy(app)

class User(db.Model):
    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    username = db.Column(db.String(80), unique=True, nullable=False)
    password = db.Column(db.String(120), nullable=False)

@app.route('/login', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def login():
    error = None
    if request.method == 'POST':
        username = request.form['username']
        password = request.form['password']
        user = User.query.filter_by(username=username, password=password).first()
        if user:
            if user.username == 'admin':
                return redirect(url_for('admin'))
            else:
                error = 'Access denied. Administrators only.'
        else:
            error = 'Invalid credentials.'
    return render_template_string('''...''', error=error)
```

**Benefits:**

- **Security:** ORM frameworks inherently protect against SQL Injection by using parameterized queries.
- **Productivity:** Simplifies database operations with higher-level abstractions.

### **4. Implement Strong Authentication Practices**

- **Password Hashing:** Store hashed passwords instead of plain text using algorithms like bcrypt or Argon2.
- **Use Authentication Libraries:** Utilize established libraries (e.g., Flask-Login) to handle user sessions securely.

### **5. Limit Database Privileges**

Grant the minimum necessary permissions to the database user. For example, the application should only have access to specific tables and actions required for its functionality.

### **6. Regular Security Audits and Code Reviews**

Periodically review code for potential vulnerabilities and employ automated security scanning tools to detect common issues.

### **7. Use Web Application Firewalls (WAF)**

Deploy WAFs to filter out malicious traffic and provide an additional layer of defense against SQL Injection and other attacks.
