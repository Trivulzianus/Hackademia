**Global Academy Student Portal Lab Preview**

Welcome to the Global Academy Student Portal Lab! In this hands-on exercise, you'll explore a web application designed to display student grade information. Start by accessing the portal using one of the default student IDs: `1001`, `1002`, or `1003`. Navigate through the interface, examine how student data is presented, and investigate deeper to discover any additional features or hidden content within the application.
